🐳 Docker Fundamentals – Solution
**Task 1: Introduction and Conceptual Understanding
Introduction: Docker in Modern DevOps

Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to be packaged with all their dependencies into a single, portable unit called a container. In modern DevOps, Docker helps ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It simplifies deployment, speeds up CI/CD pipelines, and reduces “it works on my machine” issues.

Virtualization - vs - Containerization
Aspect =	Virtualization --	Containerization
Architecture =	Runs full OS per VM --	Shares host OS kernel
Resource Usage =	Heavy -- Lightweight
Startup Time =	Minutes --	Seconds
Isolation	Strong = (hardware level) --	Process-level isolation

##Why Containerization is Preferred:
1. Faster startup and deployment
2. Better resource utilization
3. Ideal for microservices architecture
4. Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines
5. Easier scaling and rollback

**Task 2: Dockerfile for Sample Application
Sample Application
A simple Python Flask application that runs on port 80 and keeps the container alive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
##Dockerfile
# Base image (OS)
From python:3.9-slim

#Working directory
WORKDIR /app

#Copy src code to container
COPY . .

# Run the build command
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Serve the app/run the app(keep it running)
CMD ["python","run.py"]
---------------------------------------------------------------

Build Image
docker build -t python-app:latest .

Run Container
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name python-flask-app python-app:latest

Verification Commands
docker ps
docker logs 9bad67ab766d<container_id>

**Task 3: Docker Terminologies and Components

##Key Docker Terminologies

I. Image: A read-only template used to create containers.

II. Container: A running instance of an image.

III. Dockerfile: A script containing instructions to build a Docker image.

IV. Volume: Persistent storage shared between host and container.

V. Network: Enables communication between containers.

##Docker Components

I. Docker Engine: Core service that builds and runs containers.

II. Docker CLI: Command-line interface to interact with Docker Engine.

III. Docker Hub: Public registry to store and share Docker images.

IV. Docker Registry: Storage and distribution system for images.
