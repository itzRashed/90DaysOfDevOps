# 📘 Week 4: Git and GitHub Challenge

This document contains the complete solution for **Week 4 – Git and GitHub** as part of my **DevOps learning journey**.  
The challenge focuses on repository management, branching strategies, authentication methods, and hands-on Git workflows.

---

## 📋 **Task 1: Fork and Clone the Repository**

### 🔹 Fork the Repository
Fork the given repository to your personal GitHub account.

### 🔹 Verify Remote Connection (Local)
```bash
git remote -v

## 📋 **Task 2: Initialize a Local Repository and Create a File** 
🔹 Create Challenge Directory and Initialize Git
```bash
mkdir week-4-challenge
cd week-4-challenge
git init

🔹 Create and Commit File
```bash
echo "Hi This is Md Rashed Ul Islam and this is just a text file as a part of my week 4 challenge. I am writing this file from my local machine and I will push this file to my remote or github repo Also I'm in a differenct branch except master right now." > info.txt
git add info.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add info.txt with introductory content"

## 📋 **Task 3: Configure Remote URL with PAT and Push/Pull**
🔹 Connect Local Repository to Remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/itzRashed/demo-shell-scripts.git
git remote -v
🔹 Configure Remote with PAT
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://ghp_vOlyex2v7wYBHhZuYks2UZitSUZv03HW5jz@github.com/itzRashed/demo-shell-scripts.git
🔹 Push and Pull Repository
```bash
git push origin master
git pull origin master
🔹 Push New Local File
```bash
vim from_local.txt
git add from_local.txt
git commit -m "added from local"
git push origin master

## 📋 **Task 4: Explore Commit History**
🔹 View Commit History
```bash
git log

## 📋 **Task 5: Advanced Branching and Switching**
🔹 Create and Switch to Feature Branch
```bash
git branch feature-update
git checkout feature-update
git add info.txt
git commit -m "Feature update: Enhanced info.txt with additional details"
git push origin feature-update
🔹 Delete Unused Branch
```bash
git branch -d Week1_Networking

##⚔️ **Advanced: Merge Conflict Simulation**
```bash
🔹 Create Experimental Branch
git checkout -b experimental
```bash
🔹 Commit Experimental Change
```bash
echo "Project Status: Experimental build in progress" > info.txt
git add info.txt
git commit -m "Experimental:update project status"
🔹 Resolve Merge Conflict Manually
```bash
echo "Project Status: Feature update completed successfully & Experimental build tasted as well" > info.txt
git add info.txt
git commit -m "Solved merge conflict between feature-update and experimental"

## 🎁 **Bonus Task: SSH Authentication**
🔹 Generate SSH Key
```bash
ssh-keygen
🔹 Add Public Key to GitHub
```bash
Copy contents of ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
Add it under GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys
🔹 Switch Remote to SSH
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:itzRashed/90DaysOfDevOps.git
git push origin feature-update
